  <li>They ask you to transfer money using Western Union or similar.</li>
  <li>They ask for your passport or visa specifically (and send theirs even before you ask for it) before fixing a viewing appointment. What happens is that they usually take your identity later on and scam other unsuspecting people.</li>
  <li>The rent and the location doesn’t even match when compared with the other listings of similar nature, e.g., a 2 room WG at the heart of the city like Maxvorstadt for a warm rent of 800 EUR.</li>  
    </ol>
