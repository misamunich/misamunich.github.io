**Munich**, Bavaria’s capital, is home to centuries-old buildings and numerous museums. The city is known for its annual *Oktoberfest* celebration and its beer halls, including the famed _Hofbräuhaus_, founded in 1589. In the Altstadt (Old Town), central Marienplatz square contains landmarks such as Neo-Gothic Neues Rathaus (town hall), with a popular glockenspiel show that chimes and reenacts stories from the 16th century.
